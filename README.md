This model is trained using patient's clinical details dataset to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

Used preprocessing techniques - 
⦁	Remove null values
⦁	Encode categorical variables
⦁	Data scaling
⦁	Oversampling
⦁	Feature selection
⦁	Remove outliers

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated. Among the models random forest gives the best test results. Stratified K-Fold was used as a cross validation method  to evaluate model more reliably. We used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tunning to find the best hyperparameters.

Models used for training and evaluation - 
⦁	Random forest
⦁	Decision tree
⦁	Support vector machine
⦁	Multilayer perceptron
⦁	Logistic regression
⦁	K-nearest neighbors
